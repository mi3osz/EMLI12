    "Text": " This is an image of a brown squirrel. The squirrel has fluffy fur and is standing on one hind leg, with its front paws raised as if it's in the process of gathering something, possibly food or nuts. It appears to be looking slightly off-camera with a focused expression. The background is blurred but suggests an outdoor environment with green foliage, indicating that this photo may have been taken in a natural setting, possibly during the day due to the visibility and lighting conditions. ",
    "Test": " The image shows a brown squirrel with its front paws raised and holding what appears to be an acorn. It has long, fluffy fur, particularly noticeable on its back, which gives it a cuddly appearance. The squirrel's tail is not visible in the photo. The background is out of focus, but there are hints of green vegetation, suggesting that the photo was taken in a natural setting, likely during the autumn season given the presence of acorns. The squirrel's expression seems attentive and curious, as if it has found something interesting on the ground. "
