    "Text": " This image features a single giraffe walking across a flat, sandy area that resembles a desert landscape. The giraffe is standing with its neck extended forward, and its head is turned slightly to the left as it seems to be moving. It has a distinctive spotted coat in shades of brown and cream, which is characteristic of giraffes' natural patterns. The background is hazy and indistinct, giving no specific details about the environment other than the presence of sand and an open sky above. There are no other animals or objects visible in this image, and it appears to be a clear day with no immediate threat to the giraffe. ",
    "Test": " This is an image of a giraffe standing in what appears to be a desert environment. The giraffe is facing away from the camera, with its long neck and distinctive spots visible against the backdrop of the sandy terrain under a clear sky. The setting suggests a dry and arid climate, which could be indicative of habitats such as those found in parts of Africa where giraffes are native. "
