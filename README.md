# EMLI12
A project created by Team 12 for Embedded Linux
Where the team build the embedded linux setup for a next generation wildlife
camera system:
A camera that takes pictures based on different triggers; that does not need connection to the
internet but instead offloads the pictures to a drone that periodically fly across the wildlife park and
circles for a short while at each camera; and performs AI based automatic annotation of the
pictures.
