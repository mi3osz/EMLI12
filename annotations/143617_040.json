    "Text": " The image shows a small hedgehog with its quills visible, standing upright on what appears to be white gravel. The hedgehog is looking slightly away from the camera, and it seems to be in focus, with the background out of focus. In the background, there are pebbles that resemble a garden or outdoor setting. The photo has a shallow depth of field, which highlights the hedgehog while softly blurring the surroundings. There's a natural setting implied by the presence of gravel and pebbles, suggesting this might be a picture taken outdoors. "
