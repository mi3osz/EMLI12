    "Text": " The image shows a petite hedgehog standing on what appears to be gravel or small pebbles. The hedgehog is facing towards the left of the frame and seems to be either walking or resting. It has a characteristic spiky coat, which is typical of hedgehogs for protection. In the background, there's a blurred view of what looks like a garden area with pebbles and gravel spread out on the ground, providing a naturalistic setting. The overall scene is serene, showcasing the hedgehog in an outdoor environment. "
