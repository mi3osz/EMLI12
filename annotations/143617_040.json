    "Test": " In the image, there's a cute little hedgehog standing on its hind legs. The hedgehog is facing towards the left of the frame. It has dark brown or black fur, and its eyes are looking to the right. The hedgehog seems curious as it stands next to small rocks or pebbles. In the background, there's a wooden surface and what appears to be a garden bed with more pebbles. The overall scene gives a sense of a tranquil outdoor space where the hedgehog might have found food or something interesting. "
