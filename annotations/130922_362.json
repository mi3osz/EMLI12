    "Test": " The image shows a section of an interior space, likely from a ceiling-mounted camera feed. There's a close-up view with the perspective looking up towards the ceiling where the camera is attached. We can see some metallic panels or flooring that are part of a false ceiling structure, possibly in a bathroom given the presence of what appears to be a shower head and waterproofing material. The focus is on the camera lens and its attachment mechanism, which includes a circular cover on top of it, likely for cleaning purposes. There's also a small object, possibly a piece of paper or adhesive tape, partially visible in the foreground, covering part of the camera's field of view. "
