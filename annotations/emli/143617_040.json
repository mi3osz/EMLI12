    "Text": " The image shows a small, brown hedgehog with spikes perched on what appears to be a bed of gravel. The hedgehog is looking down, towards the camera or the viewer. The background consists of various colored pebbles scattered around, and it looks like there might be some plants or vegetation in the distance. The setting suggests an outdoor environment with natural elements. There are no visible texts on the image. "
