    "Test": " You've shared an image of a room with what appears to be a ceiling or wall panel missing. The top part is open, showing the interior structure of the wall, and there is a visible circular object at the center which might be a ventilation grille or a similar component. Below that, you can see a layer of insulation material. In the bottom right corner, it looks like someone's hand with a gloved finger extended as if to press or manipulate something within the open panel. The overall impression is that of an unfinished or newly renovated space, possibly in a home or office setting. "
