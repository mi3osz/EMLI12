    "Test": " The image shows a person standing by the edge of a small body of water, which appears to be a stream or river. The individual is wearing dark clothing and is looking down into the water. The surrounding environment includes a lush green landscape with trees and bushes, indicating it might be spring or summer. There's also a field with wildflowers, adding to the natural setting. A small wooden bridge can be seen in the background, suggesting this area may be used for recreational purposes such as fishing or hiking. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a soft, diffused lighting. The photo has a vertical orientation and seems to capture a peaceful moment outdoors. "
