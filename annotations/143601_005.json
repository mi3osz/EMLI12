    "Test": " This image depicts two giraffes standing close to each other in a natural setting. The giraffe on the left is looking towards the camera, while the one on the right appears to be facing away from the viewer. They are both positioned against a clear sky and there's vegetation visible in the background, suggesting they might be in a savanna or grassland habitat typical of African wildlife. Both animals have long necks and distinctive spotted patterns, which is characteristic of giraffes. "
