    "Test": " This image appears to be a photo of an interior space, likely taken from the perspective of someone outside the room. The foreground features what looks like a wall with tiles and possibly some kind of decoration or fixture attached. In the background, there's a glimpse of a room with white walls and what could be a door or window on the right side, partially obscured by the corner of another object. The image is taken in such a way that the focus is on the interior space rather than the person taking the photo. "
