    "Test": " In the image, you can see a section of a floor with a large, circular opening covered by what appears to be a transparent sheet. The surrounding area is tiled and has a reflective quality, suggesting it might be made of metal or have a metallic finish. There's a small amount of debris on the edge of the opening. In the foreground, there's a finger pressing against the transparent sheet, creating a slight reflection and distortion on the surface where it touches. The image is taken at an angle, with the floor in the lower third of the frame and the open area above. The style of the photo seems candid, possibly taken by someone inspecting or pointing out the opening in the floor. "
