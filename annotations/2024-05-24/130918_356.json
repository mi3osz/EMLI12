    "Test": " This image is a composite with two different photos. The lower portion of the image shows a clear blue sky, which indicates it might be taken outdoors during the daytime. The upper part of the photo appears to show an interior space, possibly a lobby or waiting area, as suggested by the ceiling with tiles and what looks like architectural features that could be part of a building's structure.\n\nThe photo is taken from a low angle, which is evident in the distortion at the bottom of the image where it meets the sky, creating an illusion of depth and perspective. The quality of the lower photo suggests it might have been taken with a smartphone or similar camera device due to the visible lens flare and the way the light is distributed throughout the image.\n\nThe two photos are juxtaposed in this manner without any clear connection between them, as the content of the lower photo doesn't directly relate to the sky above. The transition between the two photos is smooth and seamless, indicating that they were meant to be viewed together or that they have been digitally blended. "
