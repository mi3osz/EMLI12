    "Test": " The image you've shared appears to be a bit blurry, which makes it difficult to discern specific details. From what can be seen, there is a blue surface that might be part of a room with a modern design, possibly an interior space with a high ceiling or wall. Due to the motion blur, the focus is not sharp, and the colors are a bit muted. If you have any questions about the style of the image or the context in which it was taken, feel free to ask! "
