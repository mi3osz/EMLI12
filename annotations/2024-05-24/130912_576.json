    "Test": " This is a digital image featuring an individual in the foreground and a blurred background that appears to be an interior space with a white wall and some type of board or screen. The person in the foreground has short hair, a beard, and is smiling slightly at the camera. They are wearing a dark-colored t-shirt and the upper body is visible; no further details can be discerned due to the focus on the face and torso.\n\nIn the background, there is a computer monitor displaying a desktop with various icons and windows. The screen shows several items that suggest an active workspace, but the specifics of the content are not clear due to the blurred effect.\n\nThe image has an overlay effect where the background is desaturated and has a selective focus that keeps the person in sharp contrast while softening the details of the surrounding environment. This technique emphasizes the subject over the context, which is common in portrait photography to draw attention to the individual being photographed. "
