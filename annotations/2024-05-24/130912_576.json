    "Test": " The image shows a person taking a selfie. The individual appears to be sitting at a desk with a laptop in front of them, indicating that the photo was likely taken in an office or study space. The person is smiling and looking directly into the camera lens. They seem to have short hair and are wearing a dark top. In the background, there's a whiteboard with some writing on it, suggesting that this could be a classroom or meeting room setting. There's also another person visible in the reflection on the glass of the laptop screen, but only their back is visible as they sit behind the individual taking the selfie. The image is slightly blurred and taken from a low angle looking up at the camera lens, giving it an informal and candid quality. "
