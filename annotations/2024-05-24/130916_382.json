    "Test": " The image appears to be taken from inside a shower area, looking out. The shower floor is tiled with what seems to be a darker color compared to the walls and ceiling, which have a lighter tone. There are no visible shower fixtures or curtains in this view, but it looks like the interior of the shower unit is being cleaned or maintained. A person's hand is visible near the edge of the image, likely holding a cleaning tool, suggesting that someone is in the process of doing some work inside the shower. The focus and lighting seem to be on the floor area where there are several circular drainage spots. "
