    "Test": " This image shows an interior view of a room with a patterned ceiling. The floor is not clearly visible due to the angle and perspective of the photo. On the left side, there is a circular opening in the wall, which appears to be a hatch or access panel. It has a central round hole, suggesting it might be designed for an object like a light fixture or a ventilation grille. The room itself looks modern, with what seems to be a metallic floor and walls adorned with some sort of pattern. There is no activity visible in the photo; it captures a quiet moment within the space. "
