    "Text": " This image depicts two giraffes in their natural habitat. The giraffes are standing next to each other, facing towards the left side of the frame. They have distinctively long necks and legs, with a patterned coat that varies between individuals. The background is relatively plain, featuring a clear sky and what appears to be a flat landscape, which could suggest they are in an open grassland or savannah environment. There's no visible text within the image. "
